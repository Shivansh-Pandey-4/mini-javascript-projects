# JavaScript Mini Projects

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently learning JavaScript by building some mini projects. This repository is a collection of those projects, and it contains multiple folders, each with the code for a specific mini project. As I continue learning new concepts in JavaScript, I will keep updating this repository with more projects and code examples.

## Project Structure

This repository contains multiple project folders, each dedicated to a specific mini project. Inside each folder, you'll find the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and README files for the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Shivansh-Pandey-4/mini-javascript-projects.git

## Future Updates:

 I plan to update this repository with more mini projects in the future, each focusing on different JavaScript concepts and building more interactive applications.
