# Learning JavaScript by Building Mini Projects

I am learning JavaScript by building mini projects, and this repository will showcase my progress as I develop new projects. Each mini project helps me practice and improve my JavaScript skills. This is my **first mini project** in the series, and I plan to add more in the future!

## 1. **Mouse Hover Color Changer**

### Description:
For my first mini project, I created a box that changes color every time you move your mouse inside it. The RGB value of the box's color is also displayed above the box so that you can see the exact color.

### Features:
- The background color of the box changes when the mouse enters the box.
- The RGB color value of the box is shown on top, updating dynamically.
- The color is randomly generated each time the mouse enters the box.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS** for styling the box and positioning the RGB value display.
- **JavaScript** to handle the mouse events, generate random colors, and update the RGB value dynamically.

### How It Works:
- A `mouseenter` event listener is attached to the box to detect when the mouse enters.
- A random RGB color is generated using JavaScript.
- The box's background color is updated with the generated color, and the RGB value is displayed on top of the box.

### Project Preview:
- The box on the webpage changes color every time you move your mouse inside it.
- The exact RGB value is displayed at the top of the box, so you can see the color.

### Future Updates:
This is just the first project in my JavaScript learning journey! I plan to update this repository with more mini projects in the future, each focusing on different JavaScript concepts and building more interactive applications.

Stay tuned for more projects as I continue to learn and grow my JavaScript skills! ðŸš€
